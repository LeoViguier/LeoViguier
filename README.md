# LÃ©o Viguier

**`Computer Science Engineer Specialised in Data Science and Data Engineering`**

I am a recent graduate from a computer science engineering school in France, with a focus on software engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence. My primary areas of interest are data and AI, but I also enjoy working on profitable projects for friends and family, often involving web scraping and web automation, fields in which I have solid knowledge base. I predominantly work with Python and frequently use SQL for data storage and retrieval, as most of my projects involve working with large amounts of data.


## ðŸ’» Projects

I have several projects on my GitHub profile:

- [**`Ontology and AI`**](https://github.com/LeoViguier/DS51_Project), this project was carried out as part of the
  DS51 course at UTBM. Its purpose is to create an ontology and an AI to solve a problem related to the detection of
  animal species through
  photographs. ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-000?&logo=Python) ![Pytorch](https://img.shields.io/badge/-PyTorch-000?&logo=PyTorch) ![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-000?&logo=Pandas)
- [**`Greentext-Maker`**](https://github.com/LeoViguier/Greentext-Maker), this quick project is meant to setup a discord bot   enabling users to generate 4Chan's famous greentexts. ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-000?&logo=Python) ![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML-000?&logo=html5) ![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS-000?&logo=css3) 
- [**`Operations research`**](https://github.com/LeoViguier/IT45_Project), this project was carried out as part
  of the IT45 challenge organized by UTBM. Its purpose is to solve an optimization problem related to the management of
  specialized teachers to assist struggling students. A Genetic Algorithm is used to find the best possible schedule for the specialized teachers. ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-000?&logo=Python)
- [**`Medical Chatbot`**](https://github.com/LeoViguier/DS50_Project) this project was carried out as part of the DS50 course at UTBM. The purpose is to create a chatbot capable of diagnosing patients suffering from heart related diseases by letting them interact with it. We use cosine similarity to compare the patient's questions to those in our dataset and identify the most similar question, and give the exact answer, based on a dataset scraped on the British Health Foundation website. ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-000?&logo=Python) ![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TensorFlow-000?&logo=TensorFlow) ![GPT](https://img.shields.io/badge/-GPT-000?&logo=openai) ![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Flask-000?&logo=flask) ![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML-000?&logo=html5) ![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS-000?&logo=css3) ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Docker-000?&logo=Docker)
- [**`sketch2graph`**](https://github.com/LeoViguier/sketch2graph), This project converts a hand-drawn sketch of one or multiple graphs into a usable numpy array. ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-000?&logo=Python) ![Numpy](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Numpy-000?&logo=Numpy)

- I am also constantly working on two bussiness projects, the first one of which is an Amazon web scraping program hunting for expensive products, and the other is a web automation project. Both involve using [`undetected-chromedriver`](https://github.com/ultrafunkamsterdam/undetected-chromedriver) and are written in Python, with some SQL for the data storage.
